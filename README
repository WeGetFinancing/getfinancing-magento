This repo has been archived, please use the new: https://github.com/WeGetFinancing/magento-checkout-plugin for up to date versions of the Adobe Commerce / Magento integration.
You can read more about our up to date merchant integrations at https://wiki.dev.wegetfinancing.com/public/merchants/integrations

General Instructions
-----------------------------
1. Create your merchant account to offer monthly payment options to your consumers directly on your ecommerce from here (http://www.getfinancing.com/signup) if you haven't done it yet.
2. Download our module from the latest release here (https://github.com/GetFinancing/getfinancing-magento/releases) or all the code in a zip file from here (https://github.com/GetFinancing/getfinancing-magento/archive/master.zip)
3. Setup the module with the information found under the Integration section on your portal account https://partner.getfinancing.com/partner/portal/. Also remember to change the postback url on your account for both testing and production environments. 
4. Once the module is working properly and the lightbox opens on the request, we suggest you to add some conversion tools to your store so your users know before the payment page that they can pay monthly for the purchases at your site. You can find these copy&paste tools under your account inside the Integration section.

Module notes
------------
 - when checking out with GetFinancing, the quote only gets converted to
   an order after the loan has been preapproved.  This allows for easy
   rollback to other payment methods in case the loan is not preapproved.
 - the order is set to STATE_PAYMENT_REVIEW in Magento 1.4.1 and higher,
   and STATE_HOLDED before that.
 - Configure the postback url in the GetFinancing portal as
   getfinancing/standard/postback
   prefixed with your domain
